I’m finally getting around to uploading some of the videos I took from my 3 week trip to Europe last May. 
This is was from the Inter vs AC Milan match that Meghan and I went to at the San Siro stadium in Milan, Italy.  
We were sitting pretty far up although closer than the video makes it out to be.  The fans in Italy were pretty crazy compared to the fans in London.  
They were setting off flares and fireworks for most the game.  You can see some of it in the first video below.
